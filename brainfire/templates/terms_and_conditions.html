    <p>The following standard terms and conditions automatically apply to all projects, and clients are deemed to be in agreement with them unless alternative terms have been negotiated in advance.</p>

    <h2><small>Rates</small></h2>
    <p>Flexible rates are offered depending on the project and budget, applied per word, hour, day or project by agreement. Preferential rates can be negotiated for charities, think tanks, and other not-for-profit organizations. All work is charged at a rate of $100.00 USD per hour (rounded to the nearest half hour), unless different rates have been agreed upon in advance.</p>

    <h2><small>Estimates and quotes</small></h2>
    <p>Any estimates or quotes are generated on the basis of information provided by the client and so the client has a responsibility to provide as full and accurate information about the project as possible. Estimates are provided in good faith but are not a guarantee of final cost; clients will be advised as soon as is reasonably possible if the project is likely to cost more than the agreed estimate. Estimates and quotes will be revised in light of any work beyond the scope of the agreed parameters of the project.</p>

    <h2><small>Payment</small></h2>
    <p>Payment is to be made by bank transfer, credit card, or check. Invoices totaling less than $150.00 USD are to be paid immediately on receipt by the client. All other invoices must be paid within 21 days of the date the invoice is issued. After 21 days, unpaid invoices will automatically incur a statutory fixed penalty and invoice period interest equal 1.5% until payment is received.</p>

    <h2><small>Expenses</small></h2>
    <p>Reasonable expenses relating to the project are to be met by the client. These will be agreed in advance with the client. I will usually pay expenses at the time and submit an expenses claim with my invoice (note the interim charge caps outlined below). Payment of expenses claims is under the same terms as invoices, outlined above.</p>

    <h2><small>Interim charge caps</small></h2>
    <p>Clients can carry outstanding debts for work or expenses of up to $2,000 USD during a project. Once advised, clients with total bills exceeding $2,000 USD will need to make an interim payment to reduce the outstanding debt to below this amount or risk suspension of work.</p>

    <h2><small>Scheduling</small></h2>
    <p>Normal working hours are considered to be 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday Pacific Standard Time. Clients should not usually try to contact us outside these hours. Clients should also not usually expect responses to emails outside these hours. Exceptions will be made for projects on tight deadlines.</p>

    <h2><small>Termination of services by client</small></h2>
    <p>An invoice for any outstanding payment for work carried out to date will be issued if a client wishes to end the project at any stage and for any reason. Any work already submitted may not be used by the client in whole or in part until payment is received.</p>

    <h2><small>Unforeseen termination of a project</small></h2>
    <p>If circumstances make it impossible for me to continue a project in progress I will turn over all files for the project to the client and an issue an invoice for any outstanding payment for work carried out to date. Where possible I will assist the client in finding an alternative suitable freelancer to continue the project and provide all reasonable assistance in handing the project over.</p>

    <h2><small>Ownership rights</small></h2>
    <p>I will include my name and role (e.g. author, co-author, editor) in a submitted written product if that is appropriate â€“ this must not be altered by the client unless agreed otherwise in advance. The client must not modify any submitted written product that carries my name without my prior agreement. All work remains my exclusive property until payment is received. The client will own the copyright for any submitted work I create during a project only if a specially commissioned 'work for hire' agreement has been signed.</p>
